## Big Data
### Taught by Joseph Wilck

Class description:

The data storage and retrieval techniques that have served the information
processing industry for decades have proven inadequate in the face of the
huge collections of data presently being created by the web and the so-called
“Internet of Things.” Businesses are requiring a new set of technologies that
are specifically designed to deal with these huge data sets. In this course,
MapReduce techniques will be taught which will include parallel processing and
Hadoop, an open source framework that implements MapReduce on large-scale
data sets. Other Big Data tools will be taught that provide SQL-like access to
unstructured data: Pig and Hive. Finally, we will teach so-called NoSQL storage
solutions such as HBase.
