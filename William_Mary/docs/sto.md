Course description:

Stochastic Modeling is a foundation course in the study of business analytics.
It provides an understanding of the principals associated with modeling of
stochastic processes. The topics will include: probability theory (important
probability distributions, sampling from distributions, interaction of multiple
stochastic processes); statistical analysis (descriptive/inferential/predictive
statistics, multivariate statistics, time series models); and modeling (modeling
concepts, Monte Carlo simulation, decision analytics). Students will also be
introduced to a variety of statistical modeling packages.
