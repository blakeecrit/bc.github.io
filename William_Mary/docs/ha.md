### Heuristic Algorithms
### Taught by Jim Bradley

Course description:

Most business problems are too large or too complex to solve optimally,
where the strict meaning of “optimal” means finding the “probably” best
solution to a problem. Satisficing, or finding a heuristic solution that
approximates the optimal solution is, therefore the predominant mode of
problem solving found in industry. Having the capability of designing and
executing heuristics that more closely approach optimal solutions creates
a competitive advantage for companies. This course focuses on such
methodologies where quick but good solutions to complex problems are needed
so that they can be acted upon in a timely manner. The type of heuristic
covered in this course is the algorithm, which is a sequence of steps taken
to provide a solution to a problem.
